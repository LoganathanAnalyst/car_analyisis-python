# 🚗 Car Insurance Analysis – Case Study  
### Data Cleaning, Risk Evaluation & Exploratory Insights Using Python

---

## 📝 Executive Summary

This case study presents a complete workflow for transforming raw, inconsistent **car insurance claim data** into a clean, analysis-ready dataset.  
Using structured data-cleaning techniques and exploratory analytics, the project demonstrates how data quality directly impacts claim accuracy, risk assessment, fraud detection, and business decisions.

## 🏢 Case Background

An insurance provider collected claim records from multiple branches and legacy systems.  
The raw data included challenges such as:

- Missing policy and claim details  
- Duplicate claim entries  
- Incorrect data types (e.g., strings stored as numbers)  
- Inconsistent date formats  
- Irregular text fields (vehicle models, claim types, damage descriptions)  
- Outliers in repair cost estimates and settlement amounts  

These issues caused discrepancies in claim payouts, risk analysis, and fraud detection workflows.

## 🎯 Business Questions

The analysis aims to answer key insurance-focused questions:

1. What is the true volume and cost of valid car insurance claims?  
2. Which claim types contribute most to financial losses?  
3. Are certain vehicle categories or customer segments more prone to accidents?  
4. Do seasonal or monthly trends influence claim frequency?  
5. Are there patterns indicating possible fraudulent or abnormal claims?

## ⚙️ Methodology

A systematic data-analysis pipeline was followed:

### 1. 🔍 Data Audit  
Identification of:

- Missing values  
- Formatting inconsistencies  
- Extreme outliers  
- Duplicated claim IDs  
- Logical mismatches (e.g., negative costs, invalid dates)

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning  
A full cleaning workflow was performed:

- Duplicate removal  
- Missing value treatment  
- Standardizing categorical and text fields  
- Correcting numeric formats  
- Normalizing date fields  
- Handling extreme values in costs and repair estimates  
- Verifying claim-related fields (policy status, vehicle age, claim type)

### 3. 📈 Exploratory Analysis  
Insights were generated on:

- Claim cost distribution  
- Claim frequency by type (collision, theft, fire, liability, etc.)  
- Vehicle model and age impact on claim severity  
- Customer demographics  
- Monthly/seasonal accident trends  
- High-risk claim patterns  

### 4. ✔️ Result Validation  
Cross-checking cleaned data with business logic to ensure analytical accuracy.

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 1. Accurate Financial Corrections  
Formatting issues and data-entry errors were fixed, ensuring reliable cost and payout data.

### 2. High-Risk Claim Types  
Collision and liability claims contributed the highest loss share.

### 3. Vehicle Age & Model Impact  
Older vehicles and specific model groups exhibited significantly higher claim severity.

### 4. Irregular Claim Detection  
Unusually high repair costs and inconsistent timelines flagged possible fraud risks.

### 5. Seasonal Accident Trends  
Peaks were observed during monsoon and year-end months.
